  <h1>5 Common Reasons Your Product Listing is Not Showing on Marketplace</h1>
  <p class="date">Published on May 24, 2025</p>

  <p>As a seller, one of the most frustrating issues is when your product listing shows as “Currently Unavailable” or simply doesn’t appear in search results. Here are five common reasons and how you can fix them:</p>

  <h2>1. Missing Product Information</h2>
  <p>Ensure that all mandatory fields like product title, description, images, price, and quantity are filled in. Incomplete listings may be suppressed automatically by the platform.</p>

  <h2>2. Inventory Not Updated</h2>
  <p>If your inventory is zero or not updated, your listing will be hidden. Always make sure your stock levels are accurate in your seller dashboard.</p>

  <h2>3. Product Under Review or Hazmat Flag</h2>
  <p>Listings can be marked as hazardous material (hazmat), requiring you to upload Safety Data Sheets (SDS) or other documentation. Monitor notifications from your seller panel for action items.</p>

  <h2>4. Violation of Marketplace Policies</h2>
  <p>Your listing may be suppressed for violating policies such as prohibited items, misleading descriptions, or incorrect categorization. Review platform guidelines and correct any flagged issues.</p>

  <h2>5. Technical Glitches or Platform Delays</h2>
  <p>Sometimes listings don't reflect immediately due to server sync issues. Wait for a few hours and check back, or contact support if the issue persists.</p>

  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Regularly audit your listings and monitor seller performance metrics to prevent listing issues before they occur.</p>
