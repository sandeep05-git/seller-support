  <h1>Top 10 Mistakes New Online Sellers Make (And How to Avoid Them)</h1>

  <p>Starting as an online seller can be exciting — but it’s also easy to stumble. To help you succeed, here are the 10 most common mistakes new sellers make and how to avoid them.</p>

  <h2>1. Picking the Wrong Product</h2>
  <p>Many sellers jump into trending products without research. Instead, choose products with consistent demand and low competition.</p>
  <div class="tip">✅ Tip: Use tools like Google Trends, Amazon Best Sellers, or Flipkart Seller Hub to validate product ideas.</div>

  <h2>2. Poor Product Listings</h2>
  <p>Bad photos or vague descriptions hurt conversions.</p>
  <div class="tip">✅ Tip: Write clear titles, use high-resolution images, and include bullet points for key features.</div>

  <h2>3. Ignoring SEO</h2>
  <p>Without keywords, your listings won’t be found in search.</p>
  <div class="tip">✅ Tip: Add relevant search terms in your product title and description.</div>

  <h2>4. Underestimating Shipping Costs</h2>
  <p>New sellers often price low without factoring in shipping, hurting profits.</p>
  <div class="tip">✅ Tip: Use shipping calculators or marketplaces' rate cards to plan better.</div>

  <h2>5. Not Tracking Inventory</h2>
  <p>Overselling leads to order cancellations and poor reviews.</p>
  <div class="tip">✅ Tip: Regularly update your stock and use inventory tools or Excel trackers.</div>

  <h2>6. Ignoring Customer Service</h2>
  <p>Late replies and no resolution can damage your brand.</p>
  <div class="tip">✅ Tip: Respond to queries quickly and resolve issues politely.</div>

  <h2>7. Pricing Without Strategy</h2>
  <p>Setting prices too high or too low without market research is risky.</p>
  <div class="tip">✅ Tip: Check competitors, consider costs, and use psychological pricing (e.g., ₹499 instead of ₹500).</div>

  <h2>8. No Return or Refund Policy</h2>
  <p>Customers hesitate to buy if policies are unclear.</p>
  <div class="tip">✅ Tip: Display your return/refund policy clearly on your listing or website.</div>

  <h2>9. Not Promoting Their Store</h2>
  <p>Waiting for organic traffic alone limits growth.</p>
  <div class="tip">✅ Tip: Share on social media, run ads, or offer referral discounts to increase visibility.</div>

  <h2>10. Giving Up Too Soon</h2>
  <p>Success takes time — don't quit if you don't see sales in the first week.</p>
  <div class="tip">✅ Tip: Keep learning, optimizing, and testing new strategies.</div>

  <p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong> Avoiding these mistakes can set you on the path to becoming a successful online seller. Stay patient, stay smart!</p>
